    "### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): model selection and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified from [Evaluate Topic Models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluate-topic-model-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-7d57484bb5d0).\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is used to cluster documents in particular topics. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each document is modeled as a multinomial distribution of topics and each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution of words.\n",
    "* LDA assumes that the every chunk of text we feed into it will contain words that are somehow related. Therefore choosing the right corpus of data is crucial. \n",
    "* It also assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) for topic modelling with LDA. Gensim is a popular open-source library for unsupervised topic modeling and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim is implemented in Python and Cython, the latter for improved performance. Gensim is designed to handle large text collections using data streaming and incremental online algorithms, which differentiates it from most other machine learning software packages that target only in-memory processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We will evaluate and select topic models using a measure of topic coherence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why evaluate topic models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic topic models, such as LDA, are popular tools for text analysis, providing both a predictive and latent topic representation of the corpus. There is a longstanding assumption that the latent space discovered by these models is meaningful and useful, but evaluating such assumptions is challenging due to its unsupervised training process. Since there is a no-gold standard list of topics to compare against every corpus, we cannot compute the normal performance metrics we do for supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is still critically important to identify if a trained model is objectively good or bad, as well to compare different models/methods, and to do so, we need a quality measure. While implicit knowledge and \"eyeballing\" are popular, they are not objective approaches that can be applied systematically. We need something better, that perferably captures the model's quality in a single metric that can be maximized and compared. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the commonly used approaches for evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eye Balling Models**\n",
    "- Top N words\n",
    "- Topics / Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "- Capturing model semantics\n",
    "- Topics interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human Judgements**\n",
    "- [What is a topic?](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2009/file/f92586a25bb3145facd64ab20fd554ff-Paper.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extrinsic Evaluation Metrics/Evaluation at task**\n",
    "- Is model good at performing predefined tasks, such as clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "A big problem is that natural language is messy, ambiguous and full of subjective interpretation, and sometimes trying to de-ambiguite reduces the language to an unnatural form. Nevertheless, in order to use a single quality metric we will have to accept such risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Topic Coherence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is often used as an example of an intrinsic evaluation measure. It comes from the language modeling community and aims to capture how surprised a model is of new data it has not seen before. It is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a held-out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the log-likelihood part, you can think of the perplexity metric as measuring how probable some new unseen data is given the model that was learned earlier. That is to say, how well does the model represent or reproduce the statistics of the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[However, past research has shown that predictive likelihood (or equivalently, perplexity) and human judgment are often not correlated, and even sometimes slightly anti-correlated.](http://qpleple.com/perplexity-to-evaluate-topic-models/) And that served as a motivation for more work trying to model the human judgment, and thus `Topic Coherence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic coherence concept combines a number of papers into one framework that allows evaluating the coherence of topics inferred by a topic model. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is topic coherence?\n",
    "Topic Coherence scores a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high-scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is coherence?\n",
    "A coherent fact set is a set of statements or facts that support each other. Thus, a coherent fact set can be interpreted in a context that covers all or most of the facts. An example of a coherent fact set is \"the game is a team sport,\" \"the game is played with a ball,\" or \"the game demands great physical effort.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coherence Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `C_v` measure is based on a sliding window, one-set segmentation of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity.

    "2. `C_p` is based on a sliding window, one-preceding segmentation of the top words and the confirmation measure of Fitelson's coherence. See explanations in the [paper by Röder et al.](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/WSDM_Topic_Evaluation/public.pdf).\n",

    "5. [`C_npmi` is an enhanced version of the C_uci coherence using the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI).](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/WSDM_Topic_Evaluation/public.pdf)\n",
    "6. `C_a` is based on a context window, a pairwise comparison of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity.\n",
