Academic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the "average Wikipedian", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15â€“49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[192] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[193][194] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[195][196] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[193]
