Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[W 75] In April 2005, a Lucene extension[W 76][W 77] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch.[W 78] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[222][223][224] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy".[225] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[W 79]
