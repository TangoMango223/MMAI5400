In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[199][200] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[201] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[201] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[202]
