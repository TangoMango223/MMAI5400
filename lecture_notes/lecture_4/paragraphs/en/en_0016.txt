In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[W 19] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending changes" system in December 2012.[67] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[68] However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversity the editing community.[69]
