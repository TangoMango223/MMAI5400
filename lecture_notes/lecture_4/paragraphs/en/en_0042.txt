Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13Â percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[120] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[121] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[121] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior".[122] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[123]
